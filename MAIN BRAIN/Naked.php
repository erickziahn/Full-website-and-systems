     <h1>COMMON DREAMS:NAKED DREAMS</h1>
<h2> "I'm Naked!"</h2>
        
        <p>
            So you are going about your normal routine - going to school, waiting for the bus, shopping at the store or just walking down the street - when you suddenly realize that you have forgotten to wear pants or that you are, gasp, buck naked! Dreaming that you are completely or partially naked may be alarming, but is very common. Nudity symbolizes a variety of things depending on your real life situation.
        </p>
        <h2>Nudity indicates vulnerability:</h2>
        
        <p>
            When you are without your clothes, you are also most vulnerable. There is absolutely nothing that you can hide behind. Thus the dream may parallel a waking situation where you feel helpless or where you have completely let your guard down. Perhaps you are in a relationship where you have opened yourself up at the risk of getting rejected.
        </p>
           <h2>Nudity indicates fear of exposure:</h2>
        <p>
            
          Becoming mortified at the realization that you are naked in a public place may reflect your fear of being exposed and feelings of shame. You may be hiding something and are afraid that others can see right through you. Hence, you dream of yourself naked! 
        </p>
    
    
        <p>
           Metaphorically, clothes are a means of concealment. And depending on the type of clothes you wear, you can hide your identity or be someone else. But without your clothes, everything is hanging out for all to see. You are exposed and stripped of your defenses. Thus your naked dream may be telling you that you are trying to be someone who you really are not. You are afraid of being exposed as a fraud or phony. Such anxieties are elevated especially in situations where you are trying to impress others. Perhaps you are in a new work environment or in a new relationship. You may be apprehensive in revealing your true feelings in these situations and are afraid of being ridiculed or disgraced.  
        </p>
        <p>Nudity indicates insecurity:</p>
        <p>
            Your naked dream may also point to insecurity issues. You feel that all eyes are always on you - laughing at you, judging you or criticizing you. Being naked magnifies the notion that everyone is pointing at you and laughing. Most of the time, it's all on your head.
        </p>
        <h2>Nudity indicates feeling unprepared:</h2>
        <p>
            Nudity also symbolizes being caught off guard, not measuring up or not being ready for some important task. Finding yourself naked at work or in a classroom suggests that you feel unprepared for a project at work or school. You fear that some flaw will be brought to public attention. Dreaming of being naked is also an indication that you have set unrealistic goals where you have no way of meeting them. 
        </p>
        <h2>Nudity indicates arrogance:</h2>
            
            <p>
                Some dreams where you find yourself naked may be pointing to your arrogance in some waking situation. Perhaps you have a tendency to look down on people or think that you are better than others. By stripping you down to your birthday suit, the dream may serve to humble you.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Nudity indicates freedom of expression:</h2>
        <p>
        If you dream that you are proud of your nakedness and show no embarrassment or shame, then it symbolizes your unrestricted sense of freedom. You have nothing to hide and are proud of who you are. You are trying to get to the "bare facts." The dream relates to your honesty, openness, and carefree nature. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Nudity indicates attention:
</h2>
    <p>
        <b>In some cases, dreaming of being in the nude implies that you are looking for attention.</b> You want to get noticed, but are going about it the wrong way. You are drawing the wrong attention to yourself. 
    </P>
            
        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
        Often times, when you realize that you are naked in your dream, no one else seems to notice. Everyone else in the dream is going about their business without giving a second look at your nakedness. It just reiterates that your concerns or anxieties are your own projections; no one will notice except you. You may be magnifying the situation and making an issue out of nothing.
