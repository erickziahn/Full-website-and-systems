     <h1>Welcome to Dream Moods!</h1>

We hope that Dream Moods will help you make sense of your dreams and achieve a better understanding of them.

            <em>We realize that your dreams are unique; no other individual can have your personal background, your emotions, or your experiences.  Thus, your own dreams can only be connected to your own "reality".</em>
            
            With this in mind, it is important to draw from your personal life and experiences when interpreting a dream.
 

        </p>
    
    
        <p>
            Once you have an understanding of your dreams, it has the power to unify the body, mind, and spirit. It provides you with insight into your own self and a means for further self-exploration. You will gain a better understanding and discovery of your true self.  So stay awhile -- explore, discover, have fun, make friends, and find out what's in YOUR dream?!
